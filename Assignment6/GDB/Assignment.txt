EXERCISE 6.3: Debugging with GDB (1 point)

The task is:
 * Create at least 3 separate test functions to test `nats`,
  `print_list` and `free_list`.

 * Each function has an error, i.e., 3 in total. Use the debugger to
   find the errors, then describe the type of errors and give
   suggestions on how to fix them. You must hand in a print of your
   debug sessions and write a paragraph about how you used the
   debugger to find each error.

   Hint: You must use the debugger to do this, even though, you could
   have identified the errors without it.

 * When you run 'fbinfer' on the code, you get the warning below. You
   must explain why this warning is shown and how to avoid it.
